<p>This documentation provides an overview of the features, functions &amp; methods of Japt. For more in-depth tutorials, see the [tips for golfing in Japt](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/q/121253/) on PPCG, join the [Japt chatroom](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/34018/japt) or have a look through some [recent solutions](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/search?tab=newest&amp;q=Japt).</p>
<p>Navigate the documentation's sections via the [icon:dots-vertical] icon in the top-right corner.</p>
<p>Version labels such as [v:1.4.6] are used to indicate which version of Japt a feature or method was added in.</p>
