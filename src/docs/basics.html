<h3 class="ps">Japt Basics</h3>
<h4 class="fwm">Japt is JavaScript</h4>
<p>As Japt is based on JavaScript, anything that holds true in JS also holds true in Japt. This includes things like 0-based indexing and which values are considered truthy or falsey. Unlike JS, though, Japt supports index wrapping.</p>
<h4 class="fwm">Variables, Methods &amp; Functions</h4>
<p>The uppercase letters `A-Z` are pre-defined variables with `U-Z` being reserved for the first 6 inputs, each defaulting to `0`. See the "[variables:Variables]" section for more information.</p>
<p>The lowercase letters `a-z` and accented lowercase letters are various methods, which transpile to `.a(`, etc. See the individual "Methods" sections for more information.</p>
<p>Anonymous functions take the form `XYZ{`, which transpiles to `function(X,Y,Z){` with `X`, `Y` &amp; `Z` being the parameters.</p>
<p>`@` is equivalent to `XYZ{` and `_` is equivalent to `Z{Z`.</p>
<p>If a lowercase letter or infix operator is passed as the first argument of a method expecting a function as an argument then it is treated as a method itself. If it is preceded by a `!` then its arguments are reversed. See [this tip](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/124037/) for a more in-depth explanation of these "auto-methods".</p>
<h4 class="fwm">Parentheses</h4>
<p>Use ` ` to insert `)` and close a single method.</p>
<p>Use `)` to insert `))` and close two methods.</p>
<p>Use `¹`¹`` to insert `)))` and close three methods.</p>
<h4 class="fwm">Shortcuts</h4>
<p>Various characters between `¡`¡`` and `×`×`` transpile to sequences of 2 or more characters. See the [shortcuts:Shortcuts] section for the complete list.</p>
<p>Outside of string literals, any character preceded by a `'` is treated as a single character string. For example `'a` transpiles to `"a"`.</p>
<p>Any character preceded by a `#` is converted to the number corresponding to that character's codepoint. For example `#z` transpiles to `122`.</p>
<p>Multiple codepoints can be chained together to create larger numbers. For example `#x#y#z` transpiles to `120121122`.</p>
<h4 class="fwm">Auto-Insertion</h4>
<p>If a function or a line of a programme begins with a method name, mathematical operator, comparative operator, `&&` or `||` then the first input variable `U` is automatically inserted before it.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a variable name immediately precedes a mathematical operator, comparative operator, `&&` or `||` followed by a method call on the same variable then the variable name after the operator may be omitted (e.g., `U*x` is the same as `U*Ux`).</p>
<p>Any parentheses omitted before `}`, `]`, `;`, `:` or the end of a programme will be inserted automatically.</p>
<p>Any of ` `, `}`, `"`, `&#96;`, `$` &amp; `/` may be omitted at the end of a programme and will be inserted automatically.</p>
<h4 class="fwm">String Interpolation</h4>
<p>String interpolation is achieved similarly to JavaScript's template literals. For example `"abc{X}xyz"` transpiles to `"abc"+(X)+"xyz"`.</p>
<p>String interpolation may also be nested, with no limit to the number of levels. For example `"abc{"123{X}456"}xyz"` transpiles to `"abc"+("123"+(X)+"456")+"xyz"`.</p>
<h4 class="fwm">String Compression</h4>
<p>Japt uses the [shoco library](http://ed-von-schleck.github.io/shoco/) to compress runs of lowercase letters in strings. See the "[compression:Compression]" section for more information and details on how to use the interpreter's built-in compressor.</p>
<h4 class="fwm">Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>Whenever you start a new line in programme the result of the previous line is automatically assigned to one of the input variables `U-Z` in order before wrapping back around to `A`.</p>
<p>Anything wrapped in `$`s is evaluated as pure JavaScript.</p>
<p>Use `ß`ß`` to re-run a programme. Arguments passed to it will be used as the input variables. If any arguments are ommitted the the current value of those input variables will be passed instead.</p>
<p>In [v:2.0a0] and above `/` is used to enclose [regex:Regular Expressions] so `÷`÷`` is used for division instead.</p>
