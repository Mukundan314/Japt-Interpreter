<h3 class="ps">Interpreter</h3><p>The following is an overview of the differences between this interpreter &amp; [the official one](https://ethproductions.github.io/japt/) and some of the additional features available.</p><h4 class="fwm">Versions</h4><p>This interpreter includes support for Japt [v:1.4.5] and above only, with the current being [v:current]. Click the version number in the header to switch to a different one. Doing so will retain the values enter in the flags, code &amp; input fields, but not the explanation or compressor fields.</p><h4 class="fwm">Copying</p><p>You can copy your programme as a link, which includes the flags, code &amp; input, by clicking the [icon:link-variant] icon in the header or as markdown, ready to post to [PPCG](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/) using the [icon:markdown] icon. Markdown includes a header containing the language name, linked to the GitHub repo; the version used, if different to the current version; the flag(s) used, if any, linked to the relevant meta post on flag usage &amp; the byte count as well as your code, formatted as a code block; the link described above and, if provided the contents of the explanation field, formatted as a code block. Clicking one of the [icon:clipboard-text-outline] icons will copy the contents of the field below it.</p><h4 class="fwm">Flags<h4><p>A dedicated field is provided for [flags:flags], but as with the official interpreter, they can be entered directly into the input field instead, if you prefer.</p><h4 class="fwm">Auto-Golf</h4><p>Click the [icon:golf] icon above the code field to have the interpreter walk through your code, replacing any matches it finds for substrings that have [shortcuts:shortcuts] with those shortcuts. This may take a moment for longer programmes and/or programmes where multiple replacements can be made.</p><h4 class="fwm">Keyboard</h4><p>As Japt makes use of the full range of printables in ISO-8859-1 a character map is provided to allow you to enter characters not commonly found on all keyboards. Click the [icon:keyboard] tab at the bottom of the page and then click on a character to insert it into your could at the current location of the caret.</p><h4 class="fwm">Output Caching</h4><p>Output caching can be enabled by checking the box above the output field. While enabled, any programmes taking longer than 100ms will be written to a local cache and running the same programme (where flags, code &amp; input are identical) again will return the cached output value. The cache's size is limited to 50 programmes and it persists across sessions in the same browser. You can clear the cache by clicking the [icon:delete] icon while it is enabled.</p><h4 class="fwm">Compressor</p><p>A built-in tool, based on [this tip](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/142629/58974), is included for compressing strings and arrays. See the [compression:compression] section for more information on Japt's compression and details on how to use the compressor.</p><h4 class="fwm">Projects</p><p>Accessible via the [icon:file-document-edit] tab on the left of the page, projects allow you to locally save work-in-progress programmes, favourite solutions, custom tools, etc. for future reference. Enter some code, at least, provide a name &amp; optional challenge URL for your project and click the [icon:content-save] icon to add it to your list. Each project stores the contents of all editable fields on the page as well as the current status of output caching and the compressor's permutations. Click the [icon:play-circle] icon next to a project in your list to load and run the project, the [icon:launch] icon to open the project's challenge URL or the [icon:delete] icon to delete the project from your list.</p><h4 class="fwm">Credits</h4><ul><li class="pr">[Japt language](https://github.com/ETHproductions/japt) created and maintained by [ETHproductions](https://github.com/ETHproductions/).</li><li class="pr">This interpreter built and maintained by [Shaggy](https://github.com/PeterShaggyNoble/).</li><li class="pr">Icons by [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/).</li><li class="pr">Compressor's permutation method by [le_m](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37580979/).</li><li class="pr">Thanks to [ETHproductions](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/42545/ethproductions), [Embodiment of Ignorance](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/84206/embodiment-of-ignorance) and, in particular, [Oliver](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/61613/oliver) &amp; [ASCII-only](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/39244/ascii-only) for their feedback, suggestions and rigorous testing in the [Japt chatroom](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/34018/japt).</li></ul>
